# POL42340g1
UCD Programming for Social Scientists: Group 1 Spring 2023

## Directions:
### Important:
To keep things simple, I put all the lab files in one folder so we don't have to have a Github repo for each individual lab. The problem is that Replit.com doesn't like to have more than one project in a Repl. This works just fine if you are using anything else, but I had to make a small workaround to make sure that the Run button on replit works with the repo.
 
1. When you start a lab, open the "main.py" file. Change the line that reads "import lab1" to "import lab2" or whatever number you are working on. This just tells the Repl Run button which file to run.
2. Write your code in the file named for that lab and run as normal
   
### Setting up replit
1. Log in to replit.com
2. Create a new repl
3. In your new Repl, open the tools menu and select the Git tool
4. In the Git panel on the right, click on "Existing Git repo?"
5. In the box that comes up, enter "carlsmith23/POL42340g1" and click on the button that says "Pull changes from carlsmith23/POL42340g1"
6. Once it finishes pulling everything down from Github, in the Git panel it will show you which branch you are working on. It says "up to date with" and then the box shows "main"
7. Click the + next to that box to create a new branch. Name your branch using your name or whatever you like. Your branch is a copy of whatever is in the main branch so you have your own space to work without getting in the way of anybody else.
8. Once you get to a point where you want to save your work, you need to commit your changes. Go back to the Git tab and you will see a box that says "What did you change?". Enter a short description of what you changed since the last time you committed changes. 
9. Make sure you have your branch selected then press "Commit All & Push".    This saves all your changes to anything in the entire Repl and uploads them to the group Github.
10. You can commit as often or as little as you like, but each commit creates a version of your file that you will be able to revert back to if you need to so its a good idea to commit before you make any big changes.


### Checking Github:
1. If you want to see your branch or anybody else's, go to https://github.com/carlsmith23/POL42340g1/ and you will see the main repository.
2. Above the list of files, you should see a box with a little branching tree and the word "main", click on that to select your branch or anyone else's. 
3. Github is very cool because it lets us compare all the branches everyone else is working on and choose only the changes we like to merge back into our own branch. This also lets us choose the very best work and then merge that back into the main branch. This will be very useful once we start the group project.
