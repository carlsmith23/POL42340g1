# POL42340g1
UCD Programming for Social Scientists: Group 1 Spring 2023

## Directions:
1. Log in to replit.com
   1. Create a new repl
   2. In your new Repl, open the tools menu and selct the Git tool
   3. In the Git panel on the right, click on "Existing Git repo?"
   4. In the box that comes up, enter "carlsmith23/POL42340g1" and click on the button that says "Pull changes from carlsmith23/POL42340g1"
   5. Once it finishes pulling everything down from Github, in the Git panel it will show you which branch you are working on. It says "up to date with" and then the box shows "main"
   6. Click the + next to that box to create a new branch. Name your branch using your name or whatever you like. Your branch is a copy of whatever is in the main branch so you have your own space to work without getting in the way of anybody else.
   7. Once you get to a point where you want to save your work, you need to commit your changes. Go back to the Git tab and you will see a box that says "What did you change?". Enter a short description of what you changed since the last time you committed changes. Make sure you have your branch selected then press "Commit All & Push". This saves all your changes to anything in the entire Repl and uploads them to the group Github.
   8. You can commit as often or as little as you like, but each commit creates a version of your file that you will be able to revert back to if you need to so its a good idea to commit before you make any big changes.
2. Go to https://github.com/carlsmith23/POL42340g1/ and you will see the main repository.
   1. Above the list of files, you should see a box with a little branching tree and the word "main", click on that to see all the other branches. Click on to see your branch or anyone else's.
